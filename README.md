# ionic-upload
ionic image upload to lumen service controller
This application uses the tabs starter template to create an interface for users to upload pictures to a backend server one at a time.
# N:B
While this application is guaranteed to work, it is worth mentioning that this flow should not be used as is in a production environment. 
Its purpose is merely to serve as an eye opener to show the possiblities of sending an image from the device to a remote server.
# How it works.
Basically, on the home page, you are presented with the default ionic welcome page and two buttons.
The get image button is actually only the relevant button as the upload button has no listener attached to it.
Once you use the get image button to select a photo, the file begins to upload automatically. 
# Further customizations
You can add more functionaly to the app such as a delete button should be automatically revealed after the image is done uploading.
Also, there is need for more interactivity while the image is been uploaded to the server.
